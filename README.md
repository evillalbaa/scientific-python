# **Scientific Python Notes Repository**

Welcome to the "scientific-python" repository! This repository serves as a collection of notes and resources for the Scientific Python course offered in the Master's programs in Industrial Engineering and in the Master's program in Automation and Robotics at the School of Industrial Engineering of Barcelona (ETSEIB), UPC.

## **About the Course**

The Scientific Python course covers fundamental concepts and practical applications of Python programming in scientific and engineering contexts. Topics include data manipulation, numerical computing, data visualization, and more. These notes aim to provide comprehensive explanations, examples, and exercises to aid in your understanding of Python programming in scientific domains.

## **Contents**

The repository contains JupyterLab notebooks with lecture notes, code examples, and exercises. The notebooks are organized into topics to facilitate navigation and learning. You can find the following sections:
- **Introduction to Python:** Basic Python syntax and data types.
- I am going to add more contents in the future. (Data Manipulation: Working with data structures and libraries like NumPy and Pandas, Numerical Computing: Performing numerical computations and simulations using libraries like NumPy and SciPy, Data Visualization: Creating plots and visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Advanced Topics: Advanced Python concepts and techniques relevant to scientific programming.

## **How to Use**
Feel free to explore the notebooks and use them as a learning resource. You can clone this repository to your local machine and open the notebooks in JupyterLab to interact with the code examples and complete the exercises. Additionally, you can contribute to this repository by submitting improvements, corrections, or additional content via pull requests.

## **Who Can Benefit**

This repository is open to anyone interested in learning Python programming for scientific and engineering applications. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, these resources can help you enhance your Python skills and apply them to solve real-world problems.
