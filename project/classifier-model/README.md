# Breast Cancer Classifier Model

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases among women worldwide, with a significant impact on health and quality of life. Early detection plays a crucial role in successful treatment and patient survival.

In this project, our aim is to develop a classification model to detect the presence of breast cancer in patients using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from de UC Irvine Maching Learning Repository. 

## Instalación

This project contains a Jupyter Lab script that trains a model using a Tree Classifier. The script already includes a line that installs all the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Ejecución en Ubuntu

1. Install Jupyter Lab using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```
2. Open a terminal (Ctrl + T)

3. Navigate to the project directory

4. Execute the following command to open Jupyter Lab:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    
5. In your browser, a new tab will open with the Jupyter Lab environment. Navigate to the classifier-model.ipynb file and open it.

6. Run the script's cells in order. You can click "Run" on the Jupyter Lab toolbar or press Shift + Enter while in a cell to execute it.
